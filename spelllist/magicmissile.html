        &emsp;Use of the <i>magic missile</i> spell creates up to five missiles
        of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and
        unerringly strike their target. This includes enemy creatures in a
        melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit,
        however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits,
        can render the spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must be able to
        identify the target. He cannot direct a <i>magic missile</i> to "Strike
        the commander of the legion," unless he can single out the commander
        from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be
        singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the
        spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles to no effect.
        Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage.<br />&emsp;For
        every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional
        missile--he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level,
        etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has
        multiple missile capability, he can have them strike a single target
        creature or several creatures, as desired.
