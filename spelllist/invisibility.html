        &emsp;This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be
        undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the
        invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other
        conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see
        the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see
        invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by
        the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if
        tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Note, however,
        that light never becomes invisible, although a source of light can
        become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).
        <br />&emsp;The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or
        dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient
        attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible
        being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if he attacks,
        he immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables him to
        attack first. Note that the priest spells <i>bless, chant,</i> and
        <i>prayer</i> are not attacks for this purpose. All highly Intelligent
        (Intelligence 13 or more) creatures with 10 or more Hit Dice or levels
        of experience have a chance to detect invisible objects (they roll
        saving throws vs. spell; success means they noticed the invisible
        object).<br />&emsp;The material components of the
        <i>invisibility</i> spell are an eyelash and a bit of gum arabic, the
        former encased in the latter.
