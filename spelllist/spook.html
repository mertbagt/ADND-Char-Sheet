        &emsp;A <i>spook</i> spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears
        to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or
        something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard
        merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If the creature does
        not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at
        maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible, though items carried
        are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every
        two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level.
        Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds,
        regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not
        actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does.
        Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another
        saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell
        is broken. In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with
        Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.
