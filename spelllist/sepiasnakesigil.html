        &emsp;When this spell is cast, a small written symbol appears in the
        text of any written work. When read, the so-called sepia snake springs
        into being and strikes at the nearest living creature (but does not
        attack the wizard who cast the spell). Its attack is made as if it were
        a monster with Hit Dice equal to the level of the wizard who cast the
        spell. If it strikes successfully, the victim is engulfed in a
        shimmering amber field of force, frozen and immobilized until released,
        either at the caster's command, by a successful dispel magic spell, or
        until a time equal to 1d4 days + 1 day per caster level has elapsed.
        Until then, nothing can get at the victim, move the shimmering force
        surrounding him, or otherwise affect him. The victim does not age, grow
        hungry, sleep, or regain spells while in this state. He is not aware of
        his surroundings. If the sepia snake misses its target, it dissipates in
        a flash of brown light, with a loud noise and a puff of dun-colored
        smoke that is 10 feet in diameter and lasts for one round.<br />&emsp;The
        spell cannot be detected by normal observation, and
        <i>detect magic</i> reveals only that the entire text is magical. A
        <i>dispel magic</i> can remove it; an erase spell destroys the entire
        page of text. It can be cast in combination with other spells that hide
        or garble text.<br />&emsp;The components for the spell are 100 gp worth
        of powdered amber, a scale from any snake, and a pinch of mushroom
        spores.
