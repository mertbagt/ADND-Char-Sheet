        &emsp;This is a common and popular spell in the Land of Fate. The danger
        of the evil eye is ever-present, and the wise and the cautious often
        seek protection from its glare.<br />&emsp;Avert evil eye protects one
        creature against this danger. The wizard casts the spell upon a single
        blue bead made of glass, while voicing the recipient’s common name (or
        identity). The caster must touch the bead, but he needn’t touch the
        recipient. The bead is then sewn into the fabric of the recipient’s
        outer clothing, or crushed and placed in the recipient’s drink. Most
        rulers with a wizard handy prefer the latter method; the outward show of
        such a bead might be construed as fear, and a wise emir does not show
        fear to his people.<br />&emsp;As long as the bead is in the recipient’s
        possession—or for the duration of the spell, if it’s imbibed—any check
        against the evil eye is automatically effective. Further, avert evil eye
        provides a +1 bonus to all saving throws vs. enchantment/charm magic. It
        also provides a +2 saving throw bonus vs. the effects of the curse
        spell. It offers no protection against a curse wrought by other means
        (magical or otherwise).<br />&emsp;The reverse of this spell, attract
        evil eye, requires a black bead instead of blue. The target is allowed a
        saving throw vs. spells; if it succeeds, he is immune and the bead is
        worthless. If the saving throw fails, the target attracts the evil eye
        automatically, regardless of his own modesty and humility, with all ill
        effects as noted for this foul curse (-2 penalty to saving throws,
        ability checks, and proficiency checks; new encounters are “indifferent”
        at best). In addition, the recipient of the reverse spell suffers a -1
        penalty to all saving throws vs. enchantment/charm spells, as well as a
        -2 penalty when saving vs. all curses (not just those created by the
        spell).<br />&emsp;Avert evil eye negates the effects of attract evil
        eye, but only if the former precedes the latter. Once the evil eye is
        upon the victim, only stronger magic such as remove curse or quest can
        remove it.
