        &emsp;This spell aids in locating a known or familiar object. The wizard
        casts the spell, slowly turns, and senses when he is facing in the
        direction of the object to be located, provided the object is within
        range (i.e., 60 yards for 3rd-level wizards, 80 yards for 4th, 100 yards
        for 5th, etc.). The spell can locate such objects as apparel, jewelry,
        furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder or stairway. Note that
        attempting to find a specific item, such as jewelry or a crown, requires
        an accurate mental image; if the image is not close enough to the
        actual, the spell does not work. Desired but unique objects cannot be
        located by this spell unless they are known by the caster. The spell is
        blocked by lead. Creatures cannot be found by this spell
        <br />&emsp;The material component is a forked twig.<br />&emsp;The
        reversal, <i>obscure object</i>, hides an object from location by spell,
        crystal ball, or similar means for eight hours. Creatures cannot be
        affected by this spell. The material component is a chameleon skin.
