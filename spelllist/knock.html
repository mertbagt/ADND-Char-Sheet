        &emsp;The <i>knock</i> spell opens stuck, barred, locked, held, or
        wizard-locked doors. It opens secret doors, as well as locked or
        trick-opening boxes or chests. It also loosens welds, shackles, or
        chains. If used to open a wizard-locked door, the spell does not remove
        the former spell, but simply suspends its functioning for one turn. In
        all other cases, it permanently opens locks or welds--although the
        former could be closed and locked again later. It does not raise barred
        gates or similar impediments (such as a portcullis), nor does it affect
        ropes, vines, and the like. Note that the effect is limited by the area;
        a 3rd-level wizard can cast a <i>knock</i> spell on a door of 30 square
        feet or less (for example, a standard 4-ft. x 7-ft. door). Each spell
        can undo up to two means of preventing egress through a portal. Thus if
        a door is locked, barred, and held, or triple locked, opening it
        requires two <i>knock</i> spells. In all cases, the location of the door
        or item must be known--the spell cannot be used against a wall in hopes
        of discovering a secret door.<br />&emsp;The reverse spell, <i>lock</i>,
        closes and locks a door or similar closure, provided there is a physical
        mechanism. It does not create a weld, but it locks physically operated
        locking mechanisms, set bars, and so on, up to two functions. It cannot
        affect a portcullis.
