        &emsp;By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of
        force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has
        no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6
        or better. It is not cumulative with the <i>shield</i> spell, but it is
        cumulative with Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield
        bonus. The <i>armor</i> spell does not hinder movement or prevent
        spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until
        successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage
        totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is
        important to note that the armor does <i>not</i> absorb this damage. The
        armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage
        from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points
        from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point
        of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or
        higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the
        <i>armor</i> spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class
        gained.<br />&emsp;The material component is a piece of finely cured
        leather that has been blessed by a priest.
