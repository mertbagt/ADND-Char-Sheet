        <b>Home Town (Huzuz):</b> Askars have no special benefits other than
        those related to their <i>home town</i>. Each player should select a
        “home town” for his or her character—which may be the character’s
        birthplace, the most frequented settlement (large or small), or simply
        the location in which the character’s first adventure begins. While
        askars are in their home town, they gain a +2 bonus to proficiencies
        used while interacting with natives of that town—haggling, debate,
        etiquette, modem history, bureaucracy, and so forth. The bonus reflects
        an askar’s familiarity among the local folk. This bonus does not apply
        to craft or combat proficiencies, nor does it apply in areas more than
        one mile away from the town.
