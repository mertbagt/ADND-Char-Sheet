        &emsp;Characters with the awareness proficiency are light sleepers,
        always alert to danger and attuned to their immediate surroundings. They
        gain two key advantages: <br />&emsp;First, if they’re roused from
        slumber (during an attack at night, for example), they can react
        immediately, as if they had been awake. Provided a weapon is close at
        hand (a jambiya placed beneath the pillow, for instance), they can even
        attack during the round in which they awaken. No proficiency check is
        required. This ability does not affect magical slumber, however, such as
        that created by a <i>sleep</i> spell or related magicks.
        <br />&emsp;Second, characters with the awareness proficiency can detect
        and ward off the effects of a thief’s backstabbing ability. If a thief
        is backstabbing a target with the awareness ability, and the target is
        otherwise uninvolved in combat, then the target is granted a proficiency
        check. If the check fails, the backstabbing occurs normally. If the
        check succeeds and the target does not have initiative, the backstabbing
        proceeds, but the thief suffers a -2 attack penalty (damage bonuses
        still apply). If the check succeeds and the target has initiative, the
        target can wheel and attack the backstabbing rogue immediately, causing
        the rogue to lose all backstabbing bonuses and damage multipliers.
