      <p>
        &emsp; The character is a storehouse of facts about the history of a
        region the size of a large county or a small province. The character
        knows when the ruined tower on the hill was built and who built it (and
        what happened to him), what great heroes and villains fought and fell at
        the old battlefield, what great treasure is supposed to be kept in a
        local temple, how the mayor of the next town miraculously grew hair on
        his balding pate, and more.
        <br />&emsp;The DM will provide information about local sites and events
        as the character needs to know them. Furthermore, the character can try
        to retell these events as entertaining stories. Once the subject is
        chosen, he can either make a proficiency check and, if successful, add
        that tale to his repertoire, or actually tell the story to other
        characters. If the character succeeds in entertaining them, the player
        need not make a proficiency roll for the character, since he has
        succeeded. The character can tell these stories to entertain others,
        granting him a +2 bonus to his Charisma for the encounter. But telling
        stories to hostile beings is probably not going to do any good.
