        <!-- &emsp;Characters with the awareness proficiency are light sleepers,
        always alert to danger and attuned to their immediate surroundings. They
        gain two key advantages: <br />&emsp;First, if they’re roused from
        slumber (during an attack at night, for example), they can react
        immediately, as if they had been awake. Provided a weapon is close at
        hand (a jambiya placed beneath the pillow, for instance), they can even
        attack during the round in which they awaken. No proficiency check is
        required. This ability does not affect magical slumber, however, such as
        that created by a <i>sleep</i> spell or related magicks.
        <br />&emsp;Second, characters with the awareness proficiency can detect
        and ward off the effects of a thief’s backstabbing ability. If a thief
        is backstabbing a target with the awareness ability, and the target is
        otherwise uninvolved in combat, then the target is granted a proficiency
        check. If the check fails, the backstabbing occurs normally. If the
        check succeeds and the target does not have initiative, the backstabbing
        proceeds, but the thief suffers a -2 attack penalty (damage bonuses
        still apply). If the check succeeds and the target has initiative, the
        target can wheel and attack the backstabbing rogue immediately, causing
        the rogue to lose all backstabbing bonuses and damage multipliers. -->
        &emsp;Characters who have this proficiency can put on an impressive
        display of weapon prowess without fighting at all—swords whooshing in a
        blur, daggers flashing, arrows splitting melons in two. An individual
        must use a weapon with which he or she is already proficient, but weapon
        specialization has no further effect. The “show” takes at least a round.
        Those who are impressed are forced to make a morale check. (Results are
        outlined below.) <br />&emsp;Not everyone is swayed by weapon prowess.
        Characters must pay attention before this proficiency has an impact. For
        example, this skill might be useful in staring down a guard at the city
        gate, but would do nothing against a screaming mob or a charging band of
        desert raiders. <br />&emsp;Further, characters who have this
        proficiency must be of equal or higher level (or Hit Dice) than their
        audience to impress them. For instance, low-level warriors with flashing
        blades might awe the equally low-level city guards. But bullying their
        way through the sultan’s elite vanguard would be another matter
        entirely. Creatures of higher level or Hit Dice than an individual using
        display weapon prowess are not impressed; they do not make morale
        checks. <br />&emsp;<b>Morale Check Results:</b> Characters who make
        successful morale checks can see that an individual with this
        proficiency handles a weapon well; otherwise they’re unaffected.
        Characters who fail their morale checks react in a manner suited to the
        circumstances at hand. <br />&emsp;If the situation isn’t desperate, and
        violence isn’t inevitable, characters who fail their checks are likely
        to try talking to the individual with weapon prowess; else they’ll
        simply back away. They won’t surrender outright, but they’ll realize
        that the individual is not the sort to trifle with. <br />&emsp;In some
        instances, walking away and talking things over are not viable options.
        For example, if guards at the sultan’s treasury fail their checks,
        they’ll stay at their posts and remain willing to fight. If forced into
        combat, however, they’ll suffer a -1 attack penalty. <br />&emsp;Player
        characters are not affected by morale checks. If an individual with this
        proficiency attempts to awe a PC, the DM should provide a frank
        evaluation of the display, based on level and success. For example, the
        DM might say, “She looks darned good with that sword. Your PC might be
        able to beat her in a fair fight,” or “This son of a dark camel looks
        like he picked up his swordsmanship watching jesters in the
        marketplace.” Then it’s up to the player to decide how the PC reacts.
