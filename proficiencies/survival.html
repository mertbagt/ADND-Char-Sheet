        &emsp;This proficiency must be applied to a specific environment--i.e.,
        a specific type of terrain and weather factors. Typical environments
        include arctic, woodland, desert, steppe, mountain, or tropical. The
        character has basic survival knowledge for that terrain type. Additional
        proficiency slots can be used to add more types of terrain.
        <br />&emsp;A character skilled in survival has a basic knowledge of the
        hazards he might face in that land. He understands the effects of the
        weather and knows the proper steps to lessen the risk of exposure. He
        knows the methods to locate or gather drinkable water. He knows how to
        find basic, not necessarily appetizing, food where none is apparent,
        thus staving off starvation. Furthermore, a character with survival
        skill can instruct and aid others in the same situation. When using the
        proficiency to find food or water, the character must roll a proficiency
        check. If the check is failed, no more attempts can be made that day.
        <br />&emsp; The survival skill in no way releases the player characters
        from the hardships and horrors of being lost in the wilderness. At best
        it alleviates a small portion of the suffering. The food found is barely
        adequate, and water is discovered in minuscule amounts. It is still
        quite possible for a character with survival knowledge to die in the
        wilderness. Indeed, the little knowledge the character has may lead to
        overconfidence and doom!
