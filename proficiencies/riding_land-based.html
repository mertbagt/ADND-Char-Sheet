        &emsp; Those skilled in land riding are proficient in the art of riding
        and handling horses or other types of ground mounts. When the
        proficiency slot is filled, the character must declare which type of
        mount he is proficient in. Possibilities include griffons, unicorns,
        dire wolves, and virtually any creatures used as mounts by humans,
        demihumans, or humanoids.
        <br />&emsp;A character with riding proficiency can perform all of the
        following feats. Some of them are automatic, while others require a
        proficiency check for success. <br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;The character
        can vault onto a saddle whenever the horse or other mount is standing
        still, even when the character is wearing armor. This does not require a
        proficiency check. The character must make a check, however, if he
        wishes to get the mount moving during the same round in which he lands
        in its saddle. He must also make a proficiency check if he attempts to
        vault onto the saddle of a moving mount. Failure indicates that the
        character falls to the ground--presumably quite embarrassed.
        <br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;The character can urge the mount to jump tall
        obstacles or leap across gaps. No check is required if the obstacle is
        less than three feet tall or the gap is less than 12 feet wide. If the
        character wants to roll a proficiency check, the mount can be urged to
        leap obstacles up to seven feet high, or jump across gaps up to 30 feet
        wide. Success means that the mount has made the jump. Failure indicates
        that it balks, and the character must make another proficiency check to
        see whether he retains his seat or falls to the ground.
        <br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;The character can spur his steed on to great
        speeds, adding 6 feet per round to the animal's movement rate for up to
        four turns. This requires a proficiency check each turn to see if the
        mount can be pushed this hard. If the initial check fails, no further
        attempts may be made, but the mount can move normally. If the second or
        subsequent check fails, the mount immediately slows to a walk, and the
        character must dismount and lead the animal for a turn. In any event,
        after four turns of racing, the steed must be walked by its dismounted
        rider for one turn. <br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;The character can guide
        his mount with his knees, enabling him to use weapons that require two
        hands (such as bows and two-handed swords) while mounted. This feat does
        not require a proficiency check unless the character takes damage while
        so riding. In this case, a check is required and failure means that the
        character falls to the ground and sustains an additional 1d6 points of
        damage.<br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;The character can drop down and hang
        alongside the steed, using it as a shield against attack. The character
        cannot make an attack or wear armor while performing this feat. The
        character's Armor Class is lowered by 6 while this maneuver is
        performed. Any attacks that would have struck the character's normal
        Armor Class are considered to have struck the mount instead. No
        proficiency check is required.<br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;The character
        can leap from the back of his steed to the ground and make a melee
        attack against any character or creature within 10 feet. The player must
        roll a successful proficiency check with a -4 penalty to succeed. On a
        failed roll, the character fails to land on his feet, falls clumsily to
        the ground, and suffers 1d3 points of damage.
