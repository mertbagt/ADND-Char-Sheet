        &emsp;The bazaar is a place of give and take, where steep prices are
        demanded and modest amounts are paid. The price list for equipment in
        Chapter 6 shows three amounts for each item. The first is the “asking
        price,” the second the “normal price,” and the third the “bargain
        price.” If the DM chooses to avoid all haggling, only the normal price
        applies. But if haggling is allowed, then all three prices come into
        play in the AL-QADIM campaign.<br />&emsp; The <i>asking price</i> is
        just that—what a merchant typically asks for a given item when a buyer
        points it out. A poor haggler usually ends up paying that price. The
        <i>bargain price</i> reflects the most successful result of a haggling
        character, while the <i>normal price</i> reflects a middle ground—a sort
        of standoff or compromise between buyer and seller. <br />&emsp;Here’s
        how the proficiency works in play. A buyer with the haggling
        proficiency—usually a PC—points to an item for sale and asks the price.
        (Prices are rarely posted.) Variations exist, but as a general rule,
        merchants are assumed to have the haggling proficiency too, with a
        Wisdom of 14 to back it up. (In other words, their haggling score is
        14.) The PC makes a haggling check. The DM does the same for the
        merchant. Results are as follows:<br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;If the buyer
        makes a successful check but the merchant doesn’t, the item will sell
        for the bargain price—usually with some complaint by the merchant. (“You
        are stealing from me! You remember that it was I who was so good to you
        when next you need supplies. Now, what else may I show you?”)
        <br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;If both the buyer and the seller make
        successful checks, the merchant will not settle for less than the normal
        price, regardless of bickering.<br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;If both the
        buyer and the seller fail their checks, the merchant won’t settle for
        less than the normal price (the “fine price,” the “excellent price,” the
        “price that barely feeds my wife and my ten sick children—a virtual
        killing!”). <br /><br />&emsp;&#x2022;If the buyer fails the check but
        the seller succeeds, the merchant will hold firm to the asking price,
        and no amount of haggling will change it. (“Hah! You insult me with your
        swine-headed ways! If you think you can get a better price, then go
        somewhere else! Now, what else may I show you?”)<br /><br />&emsp;Lacking
        the haggling proficiency is the same as failing the proficiency check.
        For example, if the buyer lacks the proficiency, and the seller’s
        proficiency check fails, then the normal price applies.<br />&emsp;If
        the PCs are together, only one of them can haggle for a particular item;
        a merchant won’t begin anew with another player character. Further, the
        price of an item determined by haggling applies throughout the business
        day. Return attempts are useless until the next morning. If the
        character wishes to buy another item of the same type, the previous
        price automatically applies. A character can haggle for another kind of
        item right away, but could not, for example, attempt to buy a second
        waterskin that day from the same merchant for a better price.<br />&emsp;At
        the DM’s option, merchants may decide not to haggle with a PC who
        appears not to have the asking price in hand. (Why should merchants
        waste effort on a pauper who has no intention of buying?) “Let me see
        your silver” is a common response to a questionable buyer’s attempt to
        haggle.<br />&emsp;Bazaars are packed with all manner of goods, some
        rare and strange, such as armor imported from northern realms or an
        occasional coffee-pouring automaton. If an item is not listed in Chapter
        6, the DM should set a normal price, add 50 percent to determine the
        asking price, and subtract 25 percent from the normal price to find the
        bargain price. For example, a set of fine crystalline cups might have a
        normal price of 100 gp. The asking price would be 150 gp, and the
        bargain price would be 75 gp.
