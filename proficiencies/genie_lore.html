        &emsp;Characters with this proficiency are versed in the nature and
        background of all geniekind, from the smallest elemental gen to the
        grandest noble pasha or caliph. They know the proper manner for greeting
        and conversing with a genie—in other words, the manner least likely to
        offend the creature. In contrast, other characters must rely on
        successful Charisma checks both initially and every time they commit a
        potential <i>faux pas</i> (in the DM’s opinion).<br />&emsp;Characters
        who have genie lore also know the hierarchy and organization of
        geniekind. At a glance, they can tell whether a creature is a marid,
        djinni, dao, or efreeti. They can also say whether a creature they’re
        conversing with is noble or base.<br />&emsp;If a genie is masquerading
        as a common human, a successful proficiency check reveals the ruse. If
        this check fails, perception is completely reversed from the truth. In
        other words, the genie seems definitely to be a common person, and a
        common person seems definitely to be a genie. A character with genie
        lore can perform only one check per “suspect.” The DM rolls this check
        separately and secretly (not revealing the true results). If an
        individual with genie lore has no reason to be suspicious, the check is
        made with half the usual proficiency score, rounded down.<br />&emsp;
        Genie lore also enables a character to detect the work of genies—that
        is, the physical manifestation of genie spells, as well as items created
        by a genie’s spelllike abilities. The chance of success is limited. The
        character makes the proficiency check using half the usual score,
        rounded down. If successful, the individual may discern, for example,
        whether a wall has been constructed by genie-magic, whether a meal was
        summoned into being by a djinni, or whether a princess is enamored
        magically by the effects of a dao-granted <i>limited wish</i>.
        <br />&emsp;Genie lore does not enable a character to detect genies
        moving invisibly through the immediate area. Nor does it help the
        character see through an extraordinary disguise unless the genie is
        working some wonder of magic at the time.
