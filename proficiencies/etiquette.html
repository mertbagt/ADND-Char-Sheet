        &emsp;This proficiency gives the character a basic understanding of the
        proper forms of behavior and address required in many different
        situations, especially those involving nobility and persons of rank.
        Thus, the character will know the correct title to use when addressing a
        duke, the proper steps of ceremony to greet visiting diplomats, gestures
        to avoid in the presence of dwarves, etc. For extremely unusual
        occurrences, a proficiency check must be made for the character to know
        the proper etiquette for the situation (an imperial visit, for example,
        is a sufficiently rare event).<br />&emsp;However, having the character
        know what is correct and actually do what is correct are two different
        matters. The encounters must still be role-played by the character.
        Knowledge of etiquette does not give the character protection from a
        gaffe or faux pas; many people who know the correct thing still manage
        to do the exact opposite.
