        &emsp;The character knows most common games of chance and skill,
        including cards, dice, bones, draughts, and chess. When playing a game,
        the character may either play out the actual game (which may take too
        much time for some) or make a proficiency check, with success indicating
        victory. If two proficient characters play each other, the one with the
        highest successful die roll wins. A character with gaming proficiency
        can also attempt to cheat, thus gaining a +1 bonus to his ability score.
        If the proficiency check for the game is 17 to 20, however, the
        character has been caught cheating (even if he won the game).
