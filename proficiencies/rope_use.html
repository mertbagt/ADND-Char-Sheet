        &emsp;This proficiency enables a character to accomplish amazing feats
        with rope. A character with rope use proficiency is familiar with all
        sorts of knots and can tie knots that slip, hold tightly, slide slowly,
        or loosen with a quick tug. If the character's hands are bound and held
        with a knot, he can roll a proficiency check (with a -6 penalty) to
        escape the bonds. <br />&emsp;This character gains a +2 bonus to all
        attacks made with a lasso. The character also receives a +10% bonus to
        all climbing checks made while he is using a rope, including attempts to
        belay (secure the end of a climbing rope) companions.
