        &emsp;Characters with the debate proficiency can hold their own during
        heated discussions, remaining quick-witted and cool-tempered. They do
        not gain the ability to convince guards or holy warriors of their
        viewpoints, however. Nor can they sway the thinking of unruly hordes or
        skeptical masses. This proficiency does allow them to engage in
        meaningful arguments, impressing others with their mental faculties. As
        a result, debaters gain a +2 bonus to encounter reactions. (See Table 59
        in Chapter 11 of the DMG.) When they’re attempting to smooth ruffled
        feathers, the bonus is subtracted from the result on the dice. When
        they’re attempting to enrage another character with cheek and guile, the
        bonus is added to the dice roll. An individual with the debate
        proficiency is quite engaging. As a result, a character verbally
        battling one-on-one with such a debater is less watchful of his or her
        surroundings. Pickpocket attempts against that character are at +5
        percent, the character’s initiative is at +3, and the character’s
        ability or proficiency checks are at -3. (The debater does not suffer
        these penalties unless doing battle with another debater.) Debaters
        cannot automatically preoccupy others, however. An individual must be
        willing to talk in the first place before a debater can use this
        proficiency. Further, the proficiency doesn’t work unless the targeted
        individual is at least cautious toward the debater (if they saw eye to
        eye, there would be nothing to debate). Assuming these conditions are
        met, the debate begins. It continues until the target makes a d20 roll
        higher than his or her Intelligence score. (The smarter the individual,
        the livelier the debate, and the harder it is to end it.) Debate also
        ends if a sudden action or activity interrupts it—for example, a failed
        pickpocketing attempt, a sudden attack or magical explosion, a scream
        from the harem, and so forth. As soon as the debate ends, so do the
        penalties noted above (to initiative, ability and proficiency checks,
        and the likelihood of being robbed by a pickpocket). Two individuals
        with the debate proficiency can seek to best each other in verbal
        sparring. In this case, both make proficiency checks each round until
        one fails. Both characters are preoccupied; they suffer the penalties
        noted above while engaging each other in debate.
